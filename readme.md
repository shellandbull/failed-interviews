# failed-interviews

**failed-interviews** is a living archive of technical exercises, take-home tests, and whiteboard challenges that I didn’t pass — but chose to understand, refine, and document.

Each folder represents a single interview challenge: a snapshot of a moment when my skills met a constraint, a design met a deadline, or an assumption met reality.  
This repository isn’t a résumé of failure — it’s a **portfolio of feedback**.

## Why This Exists

Most engineers quietly discard the code from failed interviews. But there’s deep value in reflection.  
A failed interview is a kind of retrospective: a miniature post-mortem on architecture, time management, and communication under uncertainty.

By versioning these attempts, I’m aiming to:

- Capture the **real evolution of craft** — how design decisions improve over time.
- Surface recurring **anti-patterns** in my own thinking.
- Create a corpus of **"failure-driven learning"**, where each misstep becomes test data for better judgment.
